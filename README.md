### 1. Clone the Repository

### 3. Setting Up Google Cloud Console and Custom Search Engine

You need to create a Google API Key and a Custom Search Engine (CSE) to enable the search functionality for similar products.

1. Create a Google Cloud API Key

   - Search for the Custom Search API and enable it for your project.
   - After enabling, go to APIs & Services > Credentials.
   - Click Create Credentials and choose API Key.
   - Copy the generated API key for later use.

2. Create a Google Custom Search Engine (CSE)

   - Go to Google Custom Search Engine.
   - Click New Search Engine.
   - Under Sites to Search, add Search the entire web (this allows Google to search on entire internet or you can add specific website also to search on the specific website).
   - Complete the rest of the fields and click Create.

### 4. Configure the Extension with API Key and CX

- Open the popup.js file in the extension's folder.
- Locate the following lines:

```
const apiKey = "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"; // Replace with your Google API key
const cx = "YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"; // Replace with your Search Engine ID
```

- Replace "YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID" with the CX ID of your Custom Search Engine.

## Usage and Testing Instructions

- After loading the extension, navigate to the ZARA Fashion website (https://www.zara.com).
- Browse to a page with product listings.
- Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
- The extension will extract and display the product information in the popup.
- Each product will have a Find Similar button. Click it to search for similar products via Google Custom Search.

## Known Issues

- Missing Products Details: If some products details or whole product is not being extracted, this might be due to changes in the HTML structure of the ZARA Fashion website which will be some exceptional products or even due to the unavailability of the details on ZARA website only. Like the home page of zara only have advertizements so not product details over there.

- API Errors: Ensure that your API key and Custom Search Engine ID are correctly set. If your API quota exceeds, you may need to apply for a higher quota in the Google Cloud Console.

- Some product details in full page view is not visible because it is not present on the ZARA website only but when changing to multiple view we can have all the product details and other things.
